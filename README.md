# CamoGen

### ! Work in Progess !

Camo Generator thanks to statistical analysis or machine learning.

## Goal

The goal is generate camo pattern thanks to a 2D cordinates and multiples SVN (Discriminant analysis) arrays.

All thoses SVN are produced from images of differents natural field, all sorted.

So once the user will select a coordinate, it will take a percentage of each population attribute to create an unique pattern (thanks to reverse SVN) based on the distance to each SVN weighted center.

## Status
- 10 to 12 image per SVN
- Julia devellopment succeded to Python
- Displaying FFT on image at different resolution to find the best statistical data extraction
> The minimum attributes for one member of the population will be defined by the smallest image dimension or less
